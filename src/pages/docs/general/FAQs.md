# Frequently asked questions

## Is usdtweak cross platform ?

Yes, usdtweak is cross platform, it works in windows, linux and mac, but currently the viewport doesn't work in mac as the required OpenGL version is not supported.

## Does usdtweak support Arnold renderer ?

usdtweak supports any renderer through hydra render delegates, so as long as your rendering engine's delegate is properly setup, it will appear in the list of available renderers inside of usdtweak.
